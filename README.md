# Calculator-Project-CALBN-
This project was built around the idea of creating a Calculator. The process and design idea were taken from the window calculator currently available within windows 11. 
The method of creating this calculator was done by using functions that included storing information within a storage list by each user input this would enable it to stack multiple user inputs which then would combine the date when another function is manually started by the user. 
Currently, this calculator can do all the functions of a  normal calculator but still need more work due to some bugs.
